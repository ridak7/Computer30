Critical Thinking(page 275):

 #1  -  #6

#1-An event-driven application is a computer program that is written to respond to actions generated by the user or the system like GUIS'S whereas a console based application 
is a computer program designed to be used via a text-only computer interface.

#2-Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of program execution is determined by events - for example a user action such as a mouse click, key press, or a message from the operating system or another program.

#3 Yes components can be added directly to a frame When you add components to the frame you add the components to the content pane of the frame. The content pane is a JPanel. The default layout for the content pane is a BorderLayout.

When you add components directly to frame you actually are adding the components to a panel. So you have all the layout features of the panel. So in reality there is no difference for adding components to the frame or be using your own panel as the content pane of the frame.

#4 JLabels have a method which allow you to attach a MouseListener object. The MouseListener object requires a MouseAdapter() object. MouseAdapter is an abstract class which ideally serves as an Adapter for for creating on the fly listeners to do things.

#5 This is necessary because most Swing object methods are not "thread safe": invoking them from multiple threads risks thread interference or memory consistency errors.

#6 A label can be used to display a component or to display a component,whereas when user  clicks the button it outputs the results to labels
